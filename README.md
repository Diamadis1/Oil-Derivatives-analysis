I. Data set
II. Value of options over time
III. Drawing the diagrams with the values of the options as they are each Friday (closing price)
IV. Calculating the mathematical equation of the change in the value of two different options over time. (E.g. the one corresponding to (+-4) distance from the pointer and that at a distance of (+-20).
Linear Regression
Diagrams of the rate of change of the value of the (+-4) and (+-20) Options as a function of index change
V. Estimating the diagrams of the rate of change of the value of the Option (Those who are within ±4 of the pointer as well as those that are at a distance ±20) as a function of index change
CUBIC SPLINE INTERPOLATION (plots)
VI. Calculating the first differences in the value of the options and plotting the time series for the period examined for (+-4) and (+-20) options
VII. Statistical distribution of the log returns while we calculate the mean value of each one of them. In addition, we calculate the confidence intervals 5% of each one
